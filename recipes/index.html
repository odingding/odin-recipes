<li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
<li>½ tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tsp garlic, minced (or ½ tsp garlic powder)</li>
<li>½ tsp red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tsp)</li>
<li>3 tbsp avocado oil</li>
   <li> 1 medium avocado, seed removed and flesh scooped out</li>
<li>½ cup cilantro</li>
<li>1 jalapeño, seeds removed</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
<li>2 limes, juiced (3 tbsp)</li>
<li>1/2 cup plain greek yogurt</li>
<li>3 tbsp avocado oil</li>
<li>3 tbsp water</li>
<li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients: 3 tbsp avocado oil, lime juice, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, oregano, garlic, red pepper flakes, and kosher salt. Add in prepped shrimp, stir to coat all the shrimp with marinade. Place in refrigerator and marinate for max 30 minutes.</li>
<li>While the shrimp is marinating, in a food processor add the avocado crema ingredients: avocado, cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, lime juice, yogurt, olive oil, water and kosher salt. Pulse until all the ingredients are smooth. If the consistency is too thick, add another tbsp of water. Set aside.</li>
<li>Using a mandoline or knife, shred the cabbages. Place in a small bowl, add a few spoons of the avocado crema and toss to combine. Save the rest of the crema to drizzle over the tacos at the end.</li>
<li>You can either cook the shrimp in a cast iron skillet or grill them. Over medium/high heat place the shrimp into the skillet. Ensure they are all laid flat into the pan and not on top of each other, this will allow for even cooking. Depending on the size of the shrimp, they will cook in about 4-6 minutes. Flip halfway through to get a nice char/color on each side. If grilling, skewer them so they do not fall through the grates.</li>
<li>Assemble the tacos: Place the tortilla down, add a few spoons of the cabbage slaw, add a few shrimp, drizzle avocado crema over the top, garnish with fresh cilantro, serve with lime wedges!</li>
     </ol>
